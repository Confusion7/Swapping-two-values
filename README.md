## PROGRAM:

DEVELOPED BY: MOHAMMED SAAJID S
REGISTER NUMBER: 212223240093

a = int(input())
b = int(input())
c = a
a = b
b = c
print(f"Swapped values are: {a} {b}")



## RESULT:

![Pythonexp1](https://github.com/ArchanaSharikalHarinarayanan/Swapping-two-values/assets/141727149/b8de2c97-40ad-4bc9-9055-46762029a020)

Thus the swapping of two values are successfully executed
